## Generated Microprofile Starter Info

### Metrics

The Metrics exports _Telemetric_ data in a uniform way of system and custom resources. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics)

The example class **MetricController** contains an example how you can measure the execution time of a request.  The index page also contains a link to the metric page (with all metric info)

### Open API

Exposes the information about your endpoints in the format of the OpenAPI v3 specification. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-open-api)

The index page contains a link to the OpenAPI information of your endpoints.

### Open Tracing

Allow the participation in distributed tracing of your requests through various micro services. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing)

To show this capability, you need to download [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/#binaries) and run ```./jaeger-all-in-one```.
Alternatively, you can download the docker image of `all-in-one` using ```docker pull jaegertracing/all-in-one:${version}```,
followed by running the docker image. Refer to [Jaeger doc](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/) for more info.

Open [http://localhost:16686/](http://localhost:16686/) to see the traces. You have to invoke your demo app endpoint for any traces to show on Jaeger UI.
